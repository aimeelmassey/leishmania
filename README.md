# Leishmania Project: Sinop, Mato Grosso, Brazil

This repository contains the .csv files with DNA sequencing data and R scripts used for creating the master data used for analysis in the Massey et al. manuscript titled: "Using iDNA to determine impacts of Amazonian deforestation on Leishmania hosts, vectors, and their interactions."

The data collection for this project was carried out over the wet-to-dry transition season in the southern Amazon near Sinop, Mato Grosso, Brazil during 2015 and 2016. We trapped and collected sandflies and carrion flies which were then pooled by date and site and then molecularly processed for DNA metabarcoding.
